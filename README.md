# 5G_Aerial_RF_Radiation_Data

## Description

This repository contains two data sets collected at the Commerce Departmentâ€™s Radio Quiet Zone at Table Mountain, Colorado, as well as Hill Air Force Base, Utah: 

(1) Calibrated airborne field-strength measurements of spatial radiation patterns in three dimensions around 5G base station antennas; and 
(2) radiated wideband, wide dynamic range 5G transmitter base station emission spectra. 

This repository includes the full library of 5G radiation patterns for all three 5G 3700-3980 MHz base station models that are being deployed in the US; and wideband, wide dynamic range emission spectra of those same radios.

## Dataset Format

Data is contained in zipped files. Each zipped file represents a measurement campaign. Data includes measurement (.mat, .csv, xlsx) files, plot (.jpg, .fig) files, and a readme (.txt) file.

## NTIA Report

For a more in-depth exploration of how and why this data was produced, see the associated NTIA Report TR-22-562 "Measurements of 5G New Radio Spectral and Spatial Power Emissions for Radar Altimeter Interference Analysis".

## Sponsor

This report data is part of a larger program by the Joint Interagency 5G Radar Altimeter Interference (JI-FRAI) Quick Reaction Testing (QRT) to understand potential 5G interference issues. For more information about JI-FRAI, contact CDR Steve Simpson at stephen.m.simpson@uscg.mil.
